/**
 * "Is THIS install on file with Boosthis?" — the one answer the in-app panel is
 * allowed to render a registration verdict from.
 *
 * WHY THIS MODULE EXISTS
 * ----------------------
 * The panel used to decide "registered" from browser-local state alone: an
 * endpoint + an installId + a delete token held by THIS browser. The web kit
 * deliberately never persists the delete token in the runtime (only the static
 * tag persists a copy, per-browser), so the same live install read as
 * "registered" in the browser that first registered it and "Not registered yet.
 * This app has not registered with Boosthis, so nothing is being sent." in every
 * other browser — a red banner that an assisting AI reads as proof the install
 * failed. The AI would then change the install line's identity value, producing
 * a second install under the same project, and the banner would say the same
 * thing again.
 *
 * A verdict about the SERVER's records has to come from the server. This module
 * holds that answer, in FIVE internal states so the panel and the consent gate
 * can tell a real negative apart from an unanswered question:
 *
 *   pending      no answer yet (the check has not run, or is in flight)
 *   registered   we asked (or registered) and the install IS on file
 *   unregistered we asked and it is NOT on file / the key was refused
 *   unreachable  we asked and could not get an answer at all
 *   not-sent     we never asked: nothing left this page at all
 *
 * The public verdict collapses `pending`, `unreachable` and `not-sent` into
 * `"unknown"`: three outcomes, never two, so an unanswered check can never be
 * shown as a failed install and can never carry the claim that nothing is
 * being sent.
 *
 * `not-sent` exists because the kill-switch and the activation lock silence the
 * registration POST by handing the caller a locally-invented 204 — which is
 * `ok`, and was therefore read as a confirmed registration. A request that
 * never left the browser proves NOTHING about the server, so it gets a state
 * of its own rather than borrowing either answer.
 *
 * Never throws into the host: every entry point is self-guarded, and a failed
 * probe degrades to `unreachable`.
