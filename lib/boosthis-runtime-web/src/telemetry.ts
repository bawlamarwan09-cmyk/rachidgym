/** Opt-in telemetry client for the web runtime.
 *
 * Faithful (reduced-scope) port of `lib/boosthis-runtime-node/src/telemetry.ts`.
 * `enableTelemetry` registers an invited web app with the central Boosthis
 * server so it appears in the maintainer's /admin dashboard, then reports:
 *
 *   - optional full per-page samples: only in full-telemetry mode, stopped by
 *     `disable()` / `issuesOnly`;
 *   - the PII-filtered perf SNAPSHOT mirror: off in issues-only mode unless
 *     the developer opted in via `shareMeterWithAI` OR the server directive
 *     fired ("Connect AI" pressed in the web dashboard);
 *   - privacy-safe trace SPANS: ride the exact same allow-gate as the snapshot
 *     mirror (code-defined route labels only), off on a private app until
 *     sharing is authorized;
 *   - always-on CRASH reports (for registered apps): a separate channel that
 *     installs once from `enableTelemetry` and reports on its own — only the
 *     kill-switch or `forget()` can stop it;
 *   - always-on recurring-PROBLEM reports and fix outcomes (candidates +
 *     resolutions): the same always-on gate as crashes, fed from the kit's own
 *     live readings by `./reporting` and accumulated by `./candidateRules`.
 *     Nothing on this channel carries a page label — only a hashed
 *     `<kind>:<severityBucket>:<countBucket>` signature and an occurrence
 *     count.
 *
 * The kill-switch (`BOOSTHIS_DISABLED` / `globalThis.__BOOSTHIS_DISABLED__`)
 * and `forget()` behave exactly like the other runtimes.
