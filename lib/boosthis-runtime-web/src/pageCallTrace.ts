/**
 * A PAGE'S OWN CALLS, JOINED TO THE ROUTES THEY REACH — with no app code.
 *
 * Until this module, the browser kit produced a traced action only when the
 * app routed a call through `traceFetch` by hand, so in practice no browser
 * install ever sent one and no web project could show a line from a page to
 * the route it called. The kit was already standing inside every `fetch` and
 * XHR the page made (`callWatch.ts`); it simply never said who was calling.
 *
 * What happens now, for each call the page makes:
 *
 *  - The DESTINATION decides whether anything is attached at all. A call to
 *    the page's own origin is joined by default: CORS does not apply to it, so
 *    the three trace headers cost no preflight and cannot get the call
 *    refused. A call to any other host is joined ONLY when the developer named
 *    that host in `tracePropagateTo` — a custom header on a cross-origin call
 *    forces a preflight, and a host that does not allow the headers makes the
 *    browser refuse the call, so that is the developer's decision, never a
 *    default. There is no wildcard and no "every host".
 *  - The kit's gates decide it next: nothing is attached, and nothing is
 *    recorded, unless the kit is live for this visit — sharing authorized (a
 *    span submitter is wired), not switched off, not inert, and this visit
 *    measured. A header that announced a step the page will never upload
 *    would leave the server's step pointing at a parent that never arrives.
 *  - A call that already carries `x-boosthis-trace` — `traceFetch`, or the
 *    app's own `traceHeaders()` — is left exactly as it is. One boundary, one
 *    step: the explicit call wins and this module stands down.
 *
 * The step this module records is labelled with the PAGE's route label (the
 * same normalized label the page map and every sample use), so on the map the
 * page is one box and each server route it called is a line out of it. It is
 * a fresh trace whose root is this call, so its offset is 0 by construction.
 * Nothing new is stored on the visitor's device: the step rides the span
 * buffer and upload the kit already has.
