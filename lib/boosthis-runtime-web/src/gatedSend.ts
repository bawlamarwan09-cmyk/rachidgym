/* ─── One door for everything this kit sends ───────────────────────────────
 *
 * The browser runtime runs on a device that belongs to a member of the public.
 * When that person's permission is withheld, NOTHING may leave the page — and
 * "nothing" has to mean every sender, including the one somebody adds next
 * year, not the seven that existed when the gate was written.
 *
 * So the gate is a door rather than a rule: every internal upload goes through
 * `_gatedTransmitInternal`, and `__tests__/gatedSend.test.ts` fails the build if any
 * module other than this one imports `_safeTransmitInternal` directly. A new
 * sender therefore cannot bypass the gate by not knowing about it.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT INSIDE `transmit.ts`
 * ----------------------------------
 * `transmit.ts` is byte-identical to the Node runtime's copy, and that parity
 * is itself a guard (`__tests__/parity.test.ts`): the PII screen and the
 * kill-switch must behave the same in both. The Node runtime writes on a
 * server the customer operates, never on an end user's device, so it has no
 * end-user consent gate — putting one in the shared file would either break
 * the parity contract or ship a control to a kit that has nothing to gate.
 *
 * THE ONE SEND THAT IS NOT GATED
 * ------------------------------
 * Erasure. `_safeTransmitTrustedPayload` carries `/installs/forget`, and a
 * visitor who has just withdrawn permission needs that request to arrive:
 * refusing to send it would strand their data with us and call it privacy.
 * That helper is deliberately not routed through this door.
 *
 * NOT the registration handshake. `client.consent()` and `/installs/consent`
 * are the handshake that registers an install with the Boosthis server; they
 * go through this door like everything else, because registering is the first
 * thing a site whose visitor said no must not do.

 * looking at. `isNoSendResponse()` recognises it exactly, so no caller can
