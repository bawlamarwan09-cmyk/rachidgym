/* ─── One upload schedule per browser ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A website is ONE install: every tab, every reload and every teammate's page
 * uploads against the same allowance (50 measurement uploads a minute per
 * install, with crash reports kept apart, and 30 check-ins a minute). Before
 * this module none of the kit's pacing outlived a page: each reload checked
 * in again, sent a snapshot at once, restarted the first-minute ramp and sent
 * once more on close. Reloading every few seconds was enough to be told to
 * slow down (429), and the kit then filed that answer as a refused batch and
 * kept sending at its usual rate.
 *
 * This module keeps the pacing in ONE record in the kit's own storage, which
 * every tab of the browser shares and a reload keeps:
 *   • the PAUSE Boosthis asked for (a 429 and its Retry-After). Every path in
 *     every tab holds its data until the pause ends, then sends again without
 *     being told to. A pause is not a failure and is never counted as one;
 *   • when each kind of upload was last sent, and when the browser's SESSION
 *     began, so the first-minute ramp belongs to the browser, not each page;
 *   • the last check-in, so a quick run of reloads checks in once;
 *   • the server's snapshot hint and visit share (one install, many
 *     visitors: lib/snapshotPacing.ts on the server);
 *   • samples a closing page handed to the next send instead of sending.
 *
 * Where the record cannot be kept on the device — no storage, or the customer
 * holds device storage back (storage.ts answers from memory then) — every
 * function still works, per page: today's behaviour, never a failure. The
 * only thing that changes is that a closing page sends its own data rather
 * than handing it over, because a hand-over held in memory dies with the
 * page (see {@link mayHandOver}).
 *
 * docs/kit-upload-pacing.md has the counted requests this is paced against.
