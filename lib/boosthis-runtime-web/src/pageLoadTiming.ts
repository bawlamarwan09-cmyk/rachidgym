/**
 * WHAT A PAGE-LOAD READING MAY COUNT: only time a visitor spent waiting.
 *
 * A browser reading rates a page by its load: the latest "largest paint" the
 * browser reported, or the first byte when there was none. Both are timed from
 * when the DOCUMENT opened, and that clock has no idea whether anybody was
 * looking. A new customer's very first reading said their home page took more
 * than a minute to load; the next load of the same page took a fraction of a
 * second. The kit had been added to a dev page that was already open (a hot
 * update put it there), and it graded a paint from late in that page's life.
 * The stored reading could not even say which timing it was.
 *
 * The cuts below are the ones Google's web-vitals library makes:
 *   - a prerendered page's wait starts when the visitor opened it
 *     (`activationStart`), never when the browser began rendering it unseen;
 *   - a paint after the page was first hidden, after the visitor's first
 *     input, or after a restore from the back-forward cache is not part of the
 *     load.
 * And two of our own, for cases web-vitals leaves to its caller:
 *   - a dev server's hot update re-renders without navigating, so no paint
 *     after the first hot-update download belongs to the page's load;
 *   - once one paint has been accepted, a paint long after the page opened is
 *     a re-render, not the load.
 *
 * A kit that JOINS a page long after it finished loading has watched none of
 * the load, and cannot tell which of its paints anybody waited for. It does
 * not grade that page, and says so once on the console.
 *
 * Every reading also names the timing it used and how the page was opened,
 * from the two closed lists below, which the server keeps beside the number.
 *
 * Everything here is read on the page's own clock (`performance.now()`), and
 * the subtraction of `activationStart` happens only when a value is read, so a
 * prerendered page that activates later is still measured from activation.
