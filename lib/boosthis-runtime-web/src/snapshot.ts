/** Privacy-safe perf-snapshot mirror for the web runtime.
 *
 * Web parity for the Node runtime's `snapshot.ts`. It captures the current
 * in-process meter picture as ONE small, allowlisted JSON object and ships it
 * to `POST /api/snapshots` (the same ingest RN and Node use) so the
 * developer's OWN AI can read the live picture back over the hosted MCP
 * live-read tools + `GET /api/snapshot`. No new server surface is added — the
 * payload maps into the existing allowlisted snapshot fields (`capturedAt`,
 * `runtimeVersion`, `platform`, `startedAt`, `totalEvents`, `rows`, `axes`)
 * so it passes the server's `sanitizeSnapshotLabels` + PII guard unchanged.
 *
 * PRIVACY: the snapshot carries only normalized page-path labels + numeric
 * timings/counts/rating buckets — never user values, source, or PII. Route
 * keys are still filtered through the PII guard (in telemetry.ts
 * `transmitSnapshot`) before upload, and the whole payload clears
 * `assertNoPII`. Uploading is OFF by default in issues-only mode and enabled
 * only by the developer's explicit `shareMeterWithAI` opt-in or the server
 * directive once they connect an AI from the web dashboard — matching the
 * RN / Node privacy-by-default contract.
