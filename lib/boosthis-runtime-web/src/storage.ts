/** Tiny persistent key/value store for the web runtime.
 *
 * Uses `localStorage` when available (a real browser) and falls back to an
 * in-memory Map everywhere else (SSR, tests, the Node-side MCP entrypoint),
 * so callers never have to feature-detect. Every access is wrapped in
 * try/catch because `localStorage` can THROW on access in some environments
 * (Safari private mode, sandboxed iframes, storage-disabled embeds) — a
 * blocked store must degrade to memory, never crash the host page.
 *
 * All keys are namespaced under `boosthis:` so the runtime never collides
 * with (or enumerates) the host app's own storage.
 *
 * THE DURABLE HALF IS GATED.
 * --------------------------
 * `localStorage` on a visitor's browser is the visitor's own device, and
 * whether anything may be written there is the site owner's call to make on
 * their behalf — see `docs/decisions/end-user-device-storage-consent.md`.
 * `setPersistenceAllowed(false)` makes every write land in the in-memory map
 * instead, which is the SAME path a blocked store already takes, so callers
 * need no new branch: `isPersistent()` goes false and the honesty surfaces
 * that already read it say what they always said.
 *
 * The gate lives here, in the leaf, rather than in the module that owns the
 * consent state — a store that has to import the state machine could not be
 * imported BY it.
