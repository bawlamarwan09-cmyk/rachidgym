/**
 * The build's NODE_ENV, read in ONE place.
 *
 * Two decisions read it: the dev-posture debug flag (devPosture.ts) and the
 * development-page decision (developmentPage.ts). They must read the same
 * flag the same way, so neither keeps a copy of its own.
 *
 * A leaf on purpose — it imports nothing. devPosture.ts sits inside the
 * browser kit's recorded module cycle (lib/kit-module-cycles.json), and the
 * development-page decision is read while the kit is starting up; reaching
 * the flag through devPosture would pull developmentPage.ts into that cycle,
 * where a module caught half-evaluated hands back `undefined` exports without
 * a sound.
 *
 * `process.env.NODE_ENV` is the one Node name a browser bundler replaces with
 * a string literal at build time; when it was not replaced, `process` is
 * absent and this reads as `present: false`.
